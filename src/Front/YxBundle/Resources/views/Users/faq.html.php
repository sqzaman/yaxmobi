It expresses the intention of our mission statement to make jokes  portable by digitizing them.</p>

  <li><strong>Does it cost anything to       receive the text message alerts?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>No,  it's a FREE subscription service from us.  However, depending on the service plan you have with your cellular phone  carrier, standard messaging fees may apply. </p>
<a name="c11"></a>
<ol start="11" type="1">
  <li><strong>What are the payment methods?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you become a registered user, you can add funds to your account by  logging in and clicking on the 'Fill Balance' link located on your user  panel. From there, you can choose how  much money you want to add, as well as your payment method. You can pay by using either your PayPal  account, or any major credit card. </p>

<a name="c12"></a>
<ol start="12" type="1">
  <li><strong>How do I get the premium audio jokes?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are 2 service options: </p>
<p>a) <strong><em>A-la-carte</em>:</strong> as long as you have enough funds in your  account to cover the purchase, you can <br />
  select  as many audio joke(s) as you want individually, and then pay for them all at  once. Your  account balance will be adjusted accordingly. You can then use any remaining balance  with  your  future purchases. </p>
<p>b) <strong>Subscription:</strong> if you wish to receive discounts on your  purchases, you can subscribe to one of the available subscription plans. The higher the plan, the more you save. When you choose this option, you will be  billed ahead of time on a regular basis, and will be allowed to download a set  number of audio jokes/ringtones based on your subscription plan. </p>
<p> 13. <strong>I can't seem to play a file. What are the possible reasons?</strong></p>
<a name="c13"></a>
<p>a) Maybe you did not copy and paste the correct license code to unlock  the file. Please check the license code  and try again. <br />
  b) Maybe you tried to access the file from a computer different that the  one it was downloaded <br />
  on. For security reasons, the license code may  not work properly on a different computer. <br />
  Please try again by accessing  the file from the same computer it was first downloaded on. Of <br />
  course, you can always play  your files by going to your Yaxmobi account ('<strong><em>Recent </em></strong><br />
  <strong><em>Download</em></strong><em>s</em>' page).</p>
  <a name="c14"></a>
<ol start="14" type="1">
  <li><strong>How does the Premium Subscription Service work?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><u>There are several different plans to choose from. Each plan provides a set number of audio  jokes and/or ringtones. After  subscribing to a plan through our partner PayPal, simply return to the Yaxmobi  website and go to your '<em>My Subscription' page</em>. There, yo will be able to select how you want  to receive your audio jokes(email or cell phone). Whichever delivery method you choose, you  will receive the audio clips <strong>automatically!</strong> The number of clips and the frequency of  delivery depends on the selected plan.  However, regardless of the plan, basically all you have to do is <em>subscribe  and forget</em>: <strong>it's laughter on auto-pilot!</strong></u></p>

  <li><strong>I want to tell my friends about this cool website. How do I do that?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Well, first of all: THANK YOU!!  There are several ways to share the joy.  The best way is to add our free widget to your MySpace, Facebook, or any  other social networking site, website, blog, etc, and invite your friends to do  the same. This will allow you to take  the laughter with you! </p>
<p>You can also spread the laughter by clicking on the 'Tell A Friend' tab  located in the upper portion of the website. <strong></strong>From there, just shoot  them an email or send them a quick text message to tell them the website  address. If you choose to tell your  friends via email, make sure you use the Address Book Importer; that way you  will not have to try recalling your friends' email addresses. How cool is that!</p>
<p>Finally, if you like one of the demo audio jokes, you can easily send it  to your friends by clicking on the corresponding green envelope button and then  entering the requested email info. </p>
<a name="c19"></a>
<ol start="19" type="1">
